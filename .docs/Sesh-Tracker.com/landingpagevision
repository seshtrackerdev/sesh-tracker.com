# 🌿 SeshTracker Landing Page – Concept Brief (Zero-Context AI-Readable)

## 🎯 Objective

The SeshTracker landing page should introduce users to the purpose of the platform and gently guide them toward signing up or logging in — all while showcasing the value of the app through a dynamic, informative, and **interactive** walkthrough. This page should inspire curiosity, highlight the unique benefits of SeshTracker, and establish a trusted, user-friendly experience.

---

## 🧭 Core User Journey (Intent-Based Flow)

### 1. **Inspire**
> "What is this? Why should I care?"

- Use a bold headline that rotates or animates key user outcomes:
  - “Track your Strains”
  - “Understand your Usage”
  - “Visualize your High”
  - “Never Forget What Worked”

- A simple paragraph that explains the problem SeshTracker solves in one sentence.

---

### 2. **Engage**
> "Show me what it does — give me a tour"

- The page introduces an **interactive guided tour** that:
  - Animates into view after clicking “Discover SeshTracker”
  - Uses scroll or arrow keys to move between sections
  - Displays one section at a time for focus

- Each section contains:
  - A short header (e.g., “Track Effects”)
  - A relevant benefit list (e.g., “📊 Know what works, what doesn’t”)
  - Optional graphic or visual (can be abstract or data-themed)
  - A button to move forward in the tour

---

### 3. **Educate**
> "What makes this different?"

- Use sections to explain:
  - Personalized dashboards (users build their own)
  - Inventory tracking linked to real usage
  - Mood/effect correlation over time
  - It’s designed “by stoners, for stoners” (language should reflect authenticity)

---

### 4. **Convert**
> "Okay, I’m in. Let’s go."

- A final section should include:
  - Social proof (emojis, simple trust indicators like “Private”, “Free”)
  - A visual CTA element (button, icon, or symbol)
  - Direct call to action: “Start Tracking”, “Sign Up Now”, or similar

---

## 🧑‍🎨 Design Vibe

- Cannabis-themed without being cliché
- Light or dark mode ready
- Soft motion transitions and scroll effects
- Emoji-forward UX is welcome
- Fully responsive (mobile → desktop)

---

## ♿ Accessibility Requirements

- Keyboard navigable
- Semantic HTML
- Announceable regions (`aria-live`) for dynamic updates
- Skip links / visual indicator of current section
- Visible focus states

---

## 🔑 Functional Highlights

- All interaction can happen without logging in
- Only at the end does the page ask the user to sign up or log in
- The experience should feel like exploring, not reading
- Should not depend on backend API or auth to render

---

## 📂 Implementation Notes (AI Reference)

- Use a single `<LandingPage />` component as root
- Create modular subcomponents for:
  - `HeroSection` (headline)
  - `TourSection` (modular feature/benefit blocks)
  - `CallToAction` (final signup)
  - `TourManager` (manages scroll, progress, keyboard)
- Central state: `isTourStarted`, `activeSection`, `theme`

---

## 🛑 Do Not

- Do not overload the page with dense text
- Do not use modals or popups
- Do not require login to explore
- Do not use cannabis stereotypes (e.g., 420 jokes, overuse of leaves)

---

## ✅ Vision Alignment Summary

| Area | Principle |
|------|-----------|
| Interaction | Curiosity-first, no wall of text |
| Accessibility | Must be inclusive, screen-reader friendly |
| Theme | Clean, cannabis-inspired, emoji-safe |
| Call to Action | Soft. “Start Tracking” instead of “Join Now” |
| Differentiation | “By stoners, for stoners.” Personalization + privacy + insights |
