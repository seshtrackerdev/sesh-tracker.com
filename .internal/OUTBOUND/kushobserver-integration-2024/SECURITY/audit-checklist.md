# Kush.Observer Integration Security Audit Checklist (Cloudflare OpenAuth)

This document provides a comprehensive security checklist to validate the proper integration between Kush.Observer (based on Cloudflare's OpenAuth template) and Sesh-Tracker.com. Both teams should independently verify these items before production deployment.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Token Security
- [ ] Access tokens are transmitted securely via HTTPS only
- [ ] Access tokens are properly validated on each request
- [ ] Access tokens have appropriate expiration (1 hour/3600s recommended)
- [ ] Refresh tokens are stored securely in Cloudflare KV and never exposed to clients
- [ ] No sensitive tokens are stored in localStorage or session storage
- [ ] JWT signatures are verified with the proper keys from trusted sources

### User Authentication
- [ ] OAuth authorization endpoint redirects properly
- [ ] OAuth callback URLs are registered and validated
- [ ] Users can't access protected routes without authentication
- [ ] Authentication state is maintained across page reloads
- [ ] Failed login attempts are properly handled and logged with Cloudflare Analytics
- [ ] Session timeout behavior is properly implemented

### Role-Based Access Control
- [ ] Admin routes are protected from regular users
- [ ] User roles are validated server-side for all actions
- [ ] UI elements are appropriately shown/hidden based on permissions
- [ ] Role changes via Kush.Observer are reflected in real-time
- [ ] No privilege escalation possibilities in the API

## Cloudflare D1 & KV Data Protection

### User Data
- [ ] Personal information is appropriately encrypted at rest in D1
- [ ] Personal information is transmitted securely in transit
- [ ] User data is not accessible to other users
- [ ] User preferences are properly associated with accounts
- [ ] KV session data is properly scoped and isolated

### API Security
- [ ] All API endpoints require authentication where appropriate
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented via Cloudflare Workers
- [ ] Input validation is performed on all API inputs
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] CORS is properly configured for cross-origin requests

### Webhook Security
- [ ] Webhook signatures are validated for authenticity using Cloudflare's crypto APIs
- [ ] Webhook endpoints reject unauthorized requests
- [ ] Webhook secrets are securely stored in Cloudflare Worker Secrets
- [ ] Webhooks are processed idempotently (duplicate deliveries handled)
- [ ] Failed webhook processing is properly logged and retried

## Cloudflare Worker Security

### TLS Configuration
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced for all connections
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ is required; older protocols disabled via Cloudflare settings
- [ ] Strong cipher suites are configured in Cloudflare dashboard
- [ ] HSTS headers are properly set
- [ ] Certificates are automatically managed by Cloudflare

### Network Security
- [ ] Firewall rules are properly configured in Cloudflare dashboard
- [ ] Only necessary ports and services are exposed
- [ ] API endpoints are protected with Cloudflare WAF
- [ ] IP allowlisting is configured for admin functionality

## Operational Security

### Secrets Management
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in codebase
- [ ] Secrets are stored using Cloudflare Worker Secrets
- [ ] Secret rotation process is documented and tested
- [ ] Development and production secrets are separated

### Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] Authentication events are logged via Cloudflare Analytics
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts are monitored for abuse
- [ ] Webhook processing status is monitored
- [ ] Suspicious access patterns trigger alerts
- [ ] Logs don't contain sensitive information

### Incident Response
- [ ] Token revocation process is documented and tested
- [ ] User account lockout procedure is in place
- [ ] Emergency contact information for both teams is documented
- [ ] Procedure for emergency secret rotation is documented

## Compliance & Privacy

### Data Sharing
- [ ] Only necessary user data is shared between systems
- [ ] User consent for data sharing is obtained where required
- [ ] Data sharing agreements are documented
- [ ] Data retention policies are documented and implemented

### User Transparency
- [ ] Users can view what data is shared with Sesh-Tracker
- [ ] Privacy policy clearly explains data usage
- [ ] Users can request data deletion across systems

## Cloudflare OpenAuth Specific Tests

### D1 Database Security
- [ ] D1 database permissions are properly scoped
- [ ] SQL injection protections are in place
- [ ] Data is properly structured with appropriate indices
- [ ] Database migrations are properly versioned

### KV Session Storage
- [ ] Session data is properly encrypted
- [ ] Session expiration is properly enforced
- [ ] Session revocation works correctly
- [ ] KV namespace permissions are restricted

### Integration Testing

### Test Cases
- [ ] OAuth2 flow works end-to-end with appropriate redirects
- [ ] Token refresh flow works properly
- [ ] User registration propagates correctly to D1
- [ ] Role changes update permissions properly
- [ ] Account deletion removes access appropriately

### Failure Modes
- [ ] Graceful handling of D1 or KV outages
- [ ] Proper error messages when authentication fails
- [ ] Ability to recover from webhook delivery failures
- [ ] Expired token handling doesn't disrupt user experience

## Verification Steps

1. Complete a full OAuth flow trace:
   - Initial redirect to Kush.Observer authorization endpoint
   - Login with test credentials
   - Callback to Sesh-Tracker.com
   - Token validation and user session creation
   - Protected route access

2. Verify token refresh:
   - Generate an almost-expired token
   - Confirm automatic refresh behavior
   - Validate new token is properly stored

3. Test role-based access:
   - Login as regular user and confirm appropriate access
   - Login as admin user and confirm additional access
   - Change user role in Kush.Observer and verify changes propagate

4. Webhook verification:
   - Update user profile in Kush.Observer
   - Verify updates reflect in Sesh-Tracker.com
   - Test webhook signature validation
   - Test duplicate webhook delivery handling
